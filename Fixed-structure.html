<h2> Point Dume, Malibu </h2>
      
One of your first beach stops when visiting Malibu, California should be Point Dume, located right off of PCH. The beach offers visitors a tranquil retreat with its golden sands and overlooking rugged cliffs with a view of the crystal-clear waters. As you step onto the sand you're greeted by the crashing waves and the salty breeze that sweeps across the coastline. Want a bite to eat? Visit the Sunset Restaurant that is located right before the gated entrance. A classic American restaurant that offers cocktails, seafood and meat options with patio seating of the Pacific. Visitors can also hike to the cliff's edge for breathtaking views of the Malibu coastline. 
    <p></p>Directions: 
      <p></p>From Santa Monica follow Pacific Coast Highway 18-miles west to Westward Beach Road. Turn toward the ocean, go beyond the fee collection station to the very end of the road.
      <p></p>From the 101-Freeway, exit at Kanan Road, follow it south 12-miles to Pacific Coast Highway, then turn right. Westward Beach Road is over the rise, at the foot of the hill.

          <h2> Broad Beach, Malibu </h2>
      
      
    Your next stop should be Broad Beach, a long narrow public beach located in front of beautiful Malibu homes. There are barriers that provide privacy from homeowners and visitors, such as bulkheads and rock piles to additionally protect the homes from erosion. Broad Beach offers a peaceful retreat from busy city life, as you wander along the shoreline you can peacefully admire the variety of home styles as well as the rhythmic melody of the ocean. There are tide pools at the north end of the beach that separates BroadBeach from Lechuza Beach to explore. During all times of the year you can enjoy watching surfers, bodyboarders and windsurfers when conditions are favorable. 
      

      <p></p>Directions:
      
      <p></p>Look for public access stairs between homes next to the addresses 31344 and 31200 Broad Beach Road. There are limited parking spaces along the shoulder of Broad Beach Road near these entrances. Some maps also call this Trancas Beach, named for Trancas Canyon Creek that hits the sand between Broad Beach and Zuma County Beach.

          <h2> Leo Carillo State Park, Malibu  </h2>
      
      
If you're driving north from Los Angeles, Leo Carillo is one of the last beaches that you'll hit leaving Malibu. Leo Carillo is very popular among pet owners because it is one of the only beaches in the area that allows dogs as long as you're staying in the North Beach Section. So if you're traveling with any pets, Leo Carillo is the beach for you. It is one of Los Angeles' most scenic beaches, with miles of sand, sea caves and rock formations. This beach is typically uncrowded due to its location and size. Beach camping is also available at Leo Carrillo State Park for visitors who want to stay for an extended visit. 
      
      <p></p>Directions:
      
<p></p>Take the 101 freeway and exit at Kanan Road.
Go south onto Kanan Road.
Turn right onto Mulholland Highway.
Keep left to continue on Encinal Canyon Road.
Turn left to stay on Encinal Canyon Road.
Turn right onto CA-1 N, Pacific Coast Highway.
2.3 miles down, the park entrance will be on your right<p></p>
